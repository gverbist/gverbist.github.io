The command line is where the real power lies. Whether youâ€™re managing servers, editing config files, or automating workflows, having the right tools at your fingertips can seriously boost your productivity.

Letâ€™s kick things off with one of my favorite productivity boosters for the terminal:

## ðŸ§  `navi`: Interactive Cheatsheets at Your Fingertips

ðŸ“Ž [GitHub repo](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi)

`navi` is an interactive command-line cheatsheet tool that lets you browse, search, and run pre-defined commands â€” right from the terminal. Itâ€™s like muscle memory you can grep.

Why I love it:
- Lets you **search and execute snippets** using fuzzy finding
- Ideal for remembering tricky one-liners, `awk` commands, or even complex `git` workflows
- Integrates seamlessly with your shell (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`)
- Fully customizable with your own cheatsheets

Hereâ€™s what it looks like:

```bash
$ navi
