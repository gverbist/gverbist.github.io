# CachyOS: The Ultimate Gaming Distribution for Arch Enthusiasts and Beyond

In the ever-evolving landscape of Linux distributions, one name has been making waves in the gaming community: CachyOS. This Arch-based powerhouse has rapidly climbed the ranks to become a top choice for Linux gamers, offering a perfect blend of cutting-edge performance, user-friendliness, and gaming optimization. Whether you're looking to maximize your desktop gaming experience, transform your Steam Deck, or dive into wireless VR gaming, CachyOS delivers on all fronts.

## Built on Arch Linux Foundation

CachyOS stands firmly on the shoulders of Arch Linux, inheriting all the benefits that make Arch a beloved choice among power users while eliminating the complexity that often intimidates newcomers. CachyOS features the optimized linux-cachyos kernel utilizing the advanced BORE Scheduler for unparalleled performance. CachyOS does compile packages with the x86-64-v3, x86-64-v4 and Zen4 instruction set and LTO to provide a higher performance. Core packages also get PGO or BOLT optimization.

What sets CachyOS apart from other Arch-based distributions like Manjaro or EndeavourOS is its aggressive focus on performance optimization. The distribution ships with multiple kernel options, including:

- **linux-cachyos**: The default kernel tuned with custom CPU scheduling and responsiveness
- **linux-cachyos-bore**: Features the BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) scheduler for desktop fluidity
- **linux-cachyos-tt**: The TT (Temporal Tasking) scheduler, offering ultra-low latency specifically designed for gaming responsiveness

Unlike traditional Arch installations that can take hours to set up properly, CachyOS offers a choice of two installers to fit your needs: a user-friendly GUI version based on Calamares, and a CLI-based option for those who prefer a streamlined, non-graphical installation experience. This approach makes the power of Arch accessible to users who want performance without the complexity.

The distribution provides access to both official Arch repositories and the extensive AUR (Arch User Repository), ensuring compatibility with virtually any software you might need. However, what truly distinguishes CachyOS is how it optimizes these packages with advanced compiler flags and CPU-specific optimizations that squeeze every ounce of performance from modern hardware.

## CachyOS as a Premier Gaming Operating System

Gaming performance is where CachyOS truly shines, and it's not just marketing hyperbole. CachyOS is an Arch-based Linux distribution that aims to provide an ultra-fast, responsive, and secure desktop environment tailored especially for modern CPUs and high-performance tasks, such as gaming, compiling, multitasking, and content creation. The distribution has gained recognition in the gaming community for good reason.

To make things easier for you, CachyOS has grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries for gaming in Linux and a separate package for the tools and launchers/stores. The `cachyos-gaming-meta` package includes essential gaming tools like:

- **Steam** with optimized configurations
- **Lutris** for managing non-Steam games
- **Heroic Games Launcher** for Epic Games Store and GOG titles
- **MangoHud** for performance monitoring
- **Gamescope** for improved gaming sessions
- **Goverlay** for easy overlay management

What makes CachyOS particularly attractive to gamers is its custom Proton implementation. Proton-CachyOS is based on Proton's bleeding-edge branch and applies a number of modifications on top of it. This version includes performance optimizations, compatibility patches, and is compiled with the same aggressive optimization flags as the rest of the system.

The distribution also includes intelligent power management features. CachyOS provides a wrapper script game-performance which uses power-profiles-daemon to temporarily switch the current power profile to performance. The performance profile increases the system power levels and changes the CPU governor to performance. This ensures your system automatically switches to maximum performance mode when gaming and returns to normal operation afterward.

Recent updates have brought even more gaming-focused improvements. Proton-CachyOS also introduces the environment variable "PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1." When set, Proton will fetch AMD's latest FSR 4 DLL and transparently replace older FSR 3.1 libraries, sparing users from manual DLL shuffling. This kind of forward-thinking approach to gaming optimization is what sets CachyOS apart from generic distributions.

## CachyOS on Steam Deck: A SteamOS Alternative

While Valve's SteamOS provides an excellent handheld gaming experience, CachyOS offers a compelling alternative with its dedicated Handheld Edition. CachyOS provides an Edition for handheld devices, like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Legion Go. This Edition offers a SteamOS-like experience with Game Mode Switching, pre-installed Gaming Applications, and more.

The Handheld Edition is specifically optimized for portable gaming devices. The Handheld Edition employs the LAVD scheduler as the default CPU scheduler, optimized for handheld devices. This results in improved frame rates and battery life during gaming. The LAVD (Latency-Aware Virtual Deadline) scheduler is particularly well-suited for gaming workloads, providing the low-latency responsiveness that's crucial for smooth gaming on battery-powered devices.

Installation on the Steam Deck is straightforward:

1. **Download** the latest Handheld ISO from the CachyOS website
2. **Flash** the ISO to a USB drive or SD card
3. **Boot** from the installation media
4. **Follow** the Calamares installer with simple on-screen instructions
5. **Wait** for the first boot setup (Steam downloads automatically)

The first boot can take a bit of time, since Steam is getting downloaded and started. This process can take up to 2 minutes. After this initial setup, you'll have a system that provides a SteamOS-like experience with the performance benefits of CachyOS's optimizations.

The Handheld Edition includes all the gaming tools you'd expect, plus handheld-specific optimizations like automatic scaling, power button handling through Handheld Daemon (HHD), and controller support. CachyOS brings audio profiles to the ASUS ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go handhelds. Also for the CachyOS Handheld Edition is replacing gamescope-plus with Valve's upstream Gamescope compositor code.

For Steam Deck users who want more control over their system while maintaining gaming performance, CachyOS Handheld Edition offers the perfect middle ground between the simplicity of SteamOS and the flexibility of a full desktop Linux distribution.

## Wireless VR Gaming with ALVR and Quest 3

One of the most exciting aspects of Linux gaming today is the emergence of viable wireless VR solutions, and CachyOS provides an excellent platform for VR gaming with ALVR (Air Light VR). ALVR (Air Light VR) has come up as a leading solution for Quest users, allowing them to wirelessly stream PC VR games to their headsets. As one of the few tools supporting wireless VR gaming on Linux, ALVR is a vital option for Quest users looking to enjoy a seamless experience without the need for cables.

Setting up ALVR on CachyOS with a Quest 3 is surprisingly straightforward, especially compared to other Linux distributions where the process can be complex and error-prone. The optimized kernel and graphics stack in CachyOS provide an ideal foundation for the low-latency requirements of wireless VR streaming.

### Prerequisites for VR Setup

Before diving into VR gaming, ensure you have:
- **A VR-ready GPU** (NVIDIA GTX 1000 series or higher, or AMD GPU with AMF VCE support)
- **Meta Quest 3** headset
- **Wi-Fi 6 router** for optimal streaming (Wi-Fi 5 works but may limit quality)
- **Latest graphics drivers** installed on CachyOS

### Step-by-Step ALVR Setup

**1. Install ALVR on Your PC**
Download the ALVR Launcher from the official downloads page. Extract to a folder and Run(Might need to Right click > Properties> Allow executing file as program beforehand)

In the ALVR Launcher:
- Click "Add version"
- Select "Stable" channel with the latest version
- Click "Install"

**2. Install ALVR on Quest 3**
Search for "ALVR" on the Meta app in your phone(alternatively, you can use this link) - Click install and open

The Quest 3 installation is now incredibly simple thanks to ALVR being available directly in the Meta Store, eliminating the need for developer mode or sideloading.

**3. Configure the Connection**
In the launcher, press "Launch" next to the version you installed on step 1. A setup wizard will pop up, teaching how to setup firewall rules and whatnot. Follow the instructions.

The setup wizard handles most of the complex networking configuration automatically, including firewall rules and port management.

**4. Launch and Connect**
- Install and launch SteamVR (if the screen is blank initially, simply close and reopen)
- Launch the ALVR app on your Quest 3
- While the screen is on, click "Trust" next to your device's name(in the ALVR streamer app on PC, in the Devices tab) and it should start streaming

### Optimizing VR Performance

CachyOS's performance optimizations really shine in VR applications. The low-latency kernels and optimized graphics stack help minimize the motion-to-photon latency that's crucial for comfortable VR experiences. If the stream is lagging or stuttering, it might be due to wi-fi speeds/quality or hardware limitation. Try lowering resolution, bitrate and framerate(try avoiding lowering the later below 90 otherwise it might cause headaches and dizziness)

The distribution's aggressive CPU optimizations help maintain the consistent frame rates necessary for VR, while the custom kernel schedulers prioritize VR workloads for optimal performance. Most users report better performance and fewer dropped frames compared to other Linux distributions.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter the common "black screen" issue in VR, it's often related to Vulkan rendering conflicts. The CachyOS community has documented solutions for most VR-related issues, and the distribution's recent updates include many VR compatibility improvements.

For users experiencing audio issues, CachyOS's PipeWire configuration typically handles VR audio routing better than distributions using older audio systems. The optimized audio stack ensures low-latency audio streaming to the headset.
