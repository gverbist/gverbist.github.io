# About me

Hey there! I’m Geert, but everyone calls me Bist. I’m a tech enthusiast with a passion for building, gaming, and exploring. By day, I’m part of a data protection company that’s disrupting the Cyber Security space. By night (or whenever inspiration strikes), I’m crafting cool tech projects, tinkering with gadgets like ESP32, NodeMCU, and other IoT devices that make life a little smarter and more connected.

Linux (Artix is the way to go), Suckless Software, containers, and Kubernetes are my tech playgrounds. I love creating efficient, streamlined systems and experimenting with technology to see what’s possible.

When I’m not immersed in tech, you’ll find me in the worlds of World of Warcraft or Returnal, chasing adventure on my mountain bike, or diving deep underwater as a scuba enthusiast.

This blog is where I share my passions, from nerdy projects to epic gaming tales to outdoor adventures. Welcome to my corner of the internet—let’s geek out and explore together!
